## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light, desaturated blue (#90AFC5) to give a calm feeling while using the app.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F4F7) to give a clean appearance.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#D9534F) to make important elements such as call-to-action buttons stand out against the light background.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a versatile sans-serif, will be used for both headlines and body text for readability and a modern feel.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent product categories and actions; make sure all icons are in the muted orange (#D9534F).
- Use a clean, organized layout to easily manage lists. Utilize a card-based design to clearly separate each shopping list item. Maintain consistent spacing and alignment.
- Incorporate subtle animations for adding, updating, or deleting items to give feedback. Avoid intrusive animations; they should serve functionality.
